/**
 A helper class for asynchronous finding of unix paths using the `which` command.
 Standard paths are always available, but are changed if the which comes back
 with different information.
 
 @warning I do not expect that defaults, ifconfig, and ipconfig will change but
 some users like to muck with things - and those users will be on the look out
 for tools that do not pick up their particular configurations.
